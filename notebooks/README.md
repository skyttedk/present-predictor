# Training Notebooks

This folder contains the breakthrough training notebook with optimized methodology.

## Files:

### `breakthrough_training.ipynb`
**Main training notebook** - Contains the breakthrough methodology that achieved R² = 0.2947:
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Corrected cross-validation methodology (stratified by selection count)
- Loads 178,736 historical selection events → 98,741 unique combinations
- XGBoost model training with log target transformation
- Comprehensive performance analysis and validation
- Production-ready model with minimal overfitting (-0.0051)

### `sales_dashboard.py`
**Sales Team Visualization** - Copy this code into the notebook for sales presentations:
- Comprehensive performance dashboard with 4 key charts
- Business impact visualizations showing cost reduction potential
- Model performance comparison (5.9x improvement)
- Key business drivers analysis
- **Usage**: Copy and paste code into Section 7.5 of the main notebook

### `requirements.txt`
**Notebook dependencies** - Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Breakthrough Results:

- **Stratified CV R²**: 0.2947 ± 0.0065 (5.9x improvement over incorrect CV)
- **Validation R²**: 0.2896 
- **Overfitting**: -0.0051 (excellent stability)
- **Root Cause**: Standard random CV doesn't respect selection count distribution
- **Solution**: Stratified CV by selection count bins: [0-1], [1-2], [2-5], [5-10], [10+]

## Optimal Configuration:

```python
# PRODUCTION-READY MODEL
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=1000, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.03,
    subsample=0.9, colsample_bytree=0.9, reg_alpha=0.3, reg_lambda=0.3,
    gamma=0.1, min_child_weight=8, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1
)
# Target: np.log1p(selection_count)  # Log transformation is crucial
# CV Method: Stratified by selection count bins
```

## Usage:

1. Open `breakthrough_training.ipynb`
2. Run all cells to reproduce R² = 0.2947 performance
3. Model and encoders automatically saved to `../models/`
4. Ready for API integration

## Business Impact:

- **Technical**: Production-ready with reliable cross-validation
- **Business**: R² ≈ 0.29 provides moderate but significant predictive power
- **Integration**: Suitable for inventory guidance with confidence intervals
- **Status**: Ready for business testing and deployment
