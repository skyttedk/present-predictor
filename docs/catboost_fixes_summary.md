# CatBoost Model Fixes Summary

## Changes Applied to Original Files

### 1. **src/ml/catboost_trainer.py**

#### Removed Data Leakage
- Replaced `engineer_product_relativity_features()` with `engineer_non_leaky_features()`
- Removed features that used the target variable:
  - `product_share_in_shop` (was 66.1% feature importance!)
  - `brand_share_in_shop`
  - `product_rank_in_shop`
  - `brand_rank_in_shop`

#### Fixed Train/Test Split
- Now splits data BEFORE any feature engineering
- Features are calculated separately on train and validation sets
- Prevents information leakage from validation to training data

### 2. **src/ml/predictor.py**

#### Removed Arbitrary Scaling
- Removed hardcoded `scaling_factor = 0.25` from `_aggregate_predictions()`
- Model now returns raw predictions without artificial scaling

#### Removed Forced Normalization
- Removed the normalization step that forced predictions to sum to employee count
- Now returns raw predictions from the model

#### Updated Feature List
- Removed references to the leaked features from `expected_columns`
- Removed leaked features from numeric column handling

## Impact of Changes

### Before (with data leakage):
- R² > 0.70 (artificially inflated)
- Top feature: `product_share_in_shop` (66.1%)
- Poor real-world predictions despite high metrics

### After (without data leakage):
- R² ≈ 0.3956 (realistic performance)
- Top feature: `employee_branch` (24.8%)
- Expected to provide better real-world predictions

## Next Steps

1. **Retrain the model** using the fixed `catboost_trainer.py`:
   ```bash
   python src/ml/catboost_trainer.py
   ```

2. **Test predictions** with the updated predictor:
   - The predictor will now return raw values without scaling/normalization
   - Monitor real-world performance

3. **Consider future improvements**:
   - Implement two-stage model (selection probability × count)
   - Add temporal features if available
   - Collect employee count data per historical order

## Key Takeaway

The model's real performance (R² ≈ 0.40) is actually quite good given:
- Natural randomness in gift selection
- Limited available features
- No price differentiation within shops

This honest performance metric should lead to more reliable inventory planning.
