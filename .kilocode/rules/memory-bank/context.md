## Next Steps

### Critical Priority (Immediate)
1. **Data Collection Campaign**
   - Gather 2-3 years of historical gift selection data
   - Target minimum 500 unique combinations (current: 9)
   - Include multiple companies, branches, and seasonal periods
   - Expand data sources beyond current single dataset

2. **Data Assessment**
   - Analyze collected data quality and completeness
   - Validate data format consistency
   - Establish data collection processes for ongoing updates

### Short Term (With Sufficient Data)
1. **Model Retraining**
   - Retrain XGBoost model with expanded dataset
   - Target R² > 0.7 for production viability
   - Implement proper train/validation/test splits

2. **API Development**
   - Implement FastAPI endpoints for prediction service
   - Integrate three-step processing pipeline
   - Add model confidence scoring and uncertainty quantification

### Medium Term (Production Deployment)
1. **Production Preparation**
   - Deploy prediction API with sufficient model performance
   - Implement monitoring and model performance tracking
   - Create automated retraining pipeline for new data

2. **Business Integration**
   - Integrate with Gavefabrikken's inventory planning systems
   - Establish feedback loops for prediction accuracy monitoring
   - Scale system for multiple companies and seasonal periods

## Critical Blockers/Dependencies
- **Data Scarcity (CRITICAL)**: Current dataset has only 9 unique combinations vs. minimum 500 needed
- **Data Collection**: Need access to 2-3 years of historical selection data from multiple sources
- **Model Performance**: Current R² = 0.1722 insufficient for production (target: >0.7)
- **Sample-to-Feature Ratio**: 0.8:1 creates extreme overfitting risk (need 10-20:1 minimum)

## Current Model Limitations Discovered
- **Training Data**: 10 selection events → 9 unique combinations (severe data limitation)
- **Predictive Power**: Model explains only 17% of selection variance
- **Production Readiness**: 0/10 - requires 50-200x more data for viable predictions
- **Business Impact**: Current model suitable for pattern analysis only, not inventory decisions

## Key Decisions Pending
- **Data Collection Strategy**: Prioritize historical data expansion vs. waiting for new data
- **Interim Solution**: Use current model for insights while collecting more data
- **Performance Targets**: Define minimum R² threshold for different use cases
- **Data Requirements**: Establish ongoing data collection processes for model updates
