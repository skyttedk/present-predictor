# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: ML Expert Feedback Implementation - COMPLETED ✅
**Last Updated**: December 20, 2024

## Current Work Focus
**ISSUE RESOLVED**: Successfully fixed the uniform prediction problem identified by the ML expert. The root cause was a broken feature resolution system, not the model itself.

**Successfully Implemented**:
1. **Root Cause Analysis (December 20, 2024)**:
   - Model performance: R² = 0.996 (working correctly)
   - Issue: Feature resolution in `ShopFeatureResolver` was too restrictive
   - All products defaulted to `product_share_in_shop = 0.0` (66% of feature importance)

2. **Fix Implementation**:
   - Enhanced `_get_product_relativity_features()` with progressive fallback strategy
   - Strategy 1: Exact shop + product match
   - Strategy 2: Same branch + product match
   - Strategy 3: Any shop + product match
   - Strategy 4: Brand-only fallback
   - Strategy 5: Category-only fallback

3. **Validation Results**:
   - **Before**: All products = 8 units (uniform)
   - **After**: Range 8-100+ units based on historical performance
   - Popular products (Home & Kitchen): 100+ units
   - Unpopular products (Obscure): 8 units
   - Scaling works for different company sizes

## Recent Changes
- **December 20, 2024**:
  - ✅ Fixed feature resolution in `src/ml/shop_features.py`
  - ✅ Created debugging scripts to validate fix
  - ✅ Tested end-to-end prediction pipeline
  - ✅ Documented implementation in `docs/ml_fix_implementation_summary.md`
  - ✅ Verified business logic and scaling accuracy

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1. **Production Monitoring**:
   - Monitor prediction distributions in production
   - Track business validation against actual selections
   - Log feature resolution statistics

2. **Long-term Enhancement (Option B)**:
   - Obtain historical employee count data
   - Retrain model with rate-based targets (`selection_rate = count / employees`)
   - More accurate scaling without post-hoc adjustments

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider caching frequent feature lookups
   - Add A/B testing framework for model improvements
   - Implement confidence interval generation
