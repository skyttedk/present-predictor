# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: MODEL VALIDATED - Proceeding with Current Performance & Project Cleanup
**Last Updated**: June 16, 2025

## Current Work Focus
**MODEL PERFORMANCE VALIDATED - SHIFTING FOCUS TO CLEANUP**: The optimized CatBoost model (CV R¬≤ 0.5894, single split R¬≤ 0.6435) is validated and considered excellent. Further model optimizations (like Two-Stage modeling) are paused. The current focus is on cleaning up test files and redundant project files.

## Recent Changes
- ‚úÖ **PHASE 3.5 STARTED**: Commenced implementation of CatBoost and Two-Stage modeling.
- ‚úÖ **OPTUNA HYPERPARAMETER TUNING COMPLETED**: CatBoost model tuned with Optuna (15 trials) on the non-leaky feature set.
  - Optimized Validation R¬≤ (single split): **0.6435**. MAE: 0.7179, RMSE: 1.4484.
  - Stratified 5-Fold CV R¬≤ (mean): **0.5894** (std: 0.0476). This is a more robust estimate.
  - This is a significant improvement over the non-leaky pre-Optuna baseline of 0.5920.
- ‚úÖ **CATBOOST BASELINE ESTABLISHED (NON-LEAKY, PRE-OPTUNA)**: After removing leaky rank/share features during the CatBoost implementation, the model initially achieved:
  - Validation R¬≤ (original scale): **0.5920**. MAE: 0.7348, RMSE: 1.5495.
  - All 30 non-leaky features (original + existing shop features + interaction hashes) are correctly processed.
- ‚úÖ **DATA LEAKAGE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**: Previous high R¬≤ (0.9797) in initial Optuna trials was due to data leakage from rank/share features. These were removed, and Optuna was re-run on the clean feature set.
- ‚úÖ **CATBOOST DEVELOPMENT EXECUTED (NON-LEAKY)**: The CatBoost implementation with corrected feature processing and non-leaky features was completed.
  - Initial Validation R¬≤ (original scale, before Optuna, with 30 non-leaky features): **0.5920**.
  - `product_color` feature processing warning resolved.
- ‚úÖ **CATBOOST IMPLEMENTATION CREATED & DEBUGGED**: The initial CatBoost implementation was created and debugged for correct feature processing.
- ‚úÖ **EXPERT VALIDATION**: Received comprehensive ML expert analysis confirming our R¬≤ ‚âà 0.31 is reasonable given constraints.
- ‚úÖ **REALISTIC CEILING IDENTIFIED**: Upper bound with current features is R¬≤ ‚âà 0.45 (not 0.60). Reaching 0.60 requires new signal sources.
- ‚úÖ **PRICE DATA CLARIFICATION**: All gifts in a shop are in same price range, so price features won't help (important business constraint).
- ‚úÖ **NEW STRATEGY**: CatBoost with count-aware objectives + two-stage modeling identified as quick wins (5-10 p.p. R¬≤ gain expected).
- ‚úÖ **FEATURE ENGINEERING**: Successfully engineered and tested non-leaky shop assortment features.
  - Features include: `shop_main_category_diversity_selected`, `shop_brand_diversity_selected`, `shop_utility_type_diversity_selected`, `shop_sub_category_diversity_selected`, `shop_most_frequent_main_category_selected`, `shop_most_frequent_brand_selected`, `is_shop_most_frequent_main_category`, `is_shop_most_frequent_brand`.
- ‚úÖ **Performance Improvement**: New features boosted Stratified CV R¬≤ (log target) to **0.3112** (from 0.2947).
- ‚úÖ **MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Overfitting was CV methodology issue, not model limitation (previous finding, still relevant).
- ‚úÖ **Performance Breakthrough (Baseline)**: Stratified CV by selection count ‚Üí R¬≤ = 0.2947 (vs 0.05 with incorrect CV).
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified**: Standard random CV doesn't respect selection count distribution structure.

## Current State
- **Repository**: üöÄ Updated with the initial CatBoost implementation. The XGBoost development work remains as a baseline.
- **Data Processing**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - 178,736 events ‚Üí 98,741 combinations processed correctly. Shop features added.
- **Model Performance**: ‚≠ê **EXCELLENT - OPTIMIZED CatBoost CV R¬≤ = 0.5894** (mean of 5-fold stratified CV, original scale, non-leaky features, Optuna tuned). Single validation split R¬≤=0.6435. This performance is very strong, robust, and significantly exceeds initial expectations.
- **Cross-Validation**: ‚úÖ Stratified 5-Fold CV successfully implemented and validated for the optimized CatBoost model.
- **Overfitting Control**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Minimal overfitting observed with the tuned CatBoost model and non-leaky features.
- **Business Integration**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR API INTEGRATION PLANNING** - The current high-performing CatBoost model provides significant business value and is ready for the next steps in API integration planning.
- **Expert Feedback**: ‚úÖ **RECEIVED** - Comprehensive guidance on next optimization steps and realistic expectations.

## Critical Technical Insights (BREAKTHROUGH & ENHANCEMENT)

### Root Cause of Previous Issues (Overfitting pre-0.2947)
- **Problem**: Standard random CV splits don't respect selection count distribution.
- **Solution**: Stratified CV by selection count bins: [0-1], [1-2], [2-5], [5-10], [10+].
- **Impact**: Performance estimate improved from R¬≤ ‚âà 0.05 to R¬≤ = 0.2947 (5.9x improvement).

### Shop Assortment Feature Impact
- **Enhancement**: Non-leaky shop-level features (diversity, most frequent selected category/brand, product's relation to these) further improved model performance.
- **Result**: CV R¬≤ (log target) increased from 0.2947 to **0.3112**.
- **Key New Features**: `shop_main_category_diversity_selected`, `shop_brand_diversity_selected`, `is_shop_most_frequent_main_category`, etc.
