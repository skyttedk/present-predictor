# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: MODEL OPTIMIZATION - Expert-Guided CatBoost & Two-Stage Implementation
**Last Updated**: June 15, 2025

## Current Work Focus
**PARADIGM SHIFT**: Moving from XGBoost to CatBoost with Poisson loss and implementing two-stage modeling approach based on ML expert feedback. Current R¬≤ ‚âà 0.3112 is actually respectable given natural noise and sparsity constraints.

## Recent Changes
- ‚úÖ **EXPERT VALIDATION**: Received comprehensive ML expert analysis confirming our R¬≤ ‚âà 0.31 is reasonable given constraints.
- ‚úÖ **REALISTIC CEILING IDENTIFIED**: Upper bound with current features is R¬≤ ‚âà 0.45 (not 0.60). Reaching 0.60 requires new signal sources.
- ‚úÖ **PRICE DATA CLARIFICATION**: All gifts in a shop are in same price range, so price features won't help (important business constraint).
- ‚úÖ **NEW STRATEGY**: CatBoost with count-aware objectives + two-stage modeling identified as quick wins (5-10 p.p. R¬≤ gain expected).
- ‚úÖ **FEATURE ENGINEERING**: Successfully engineered and tested non-leaky shop assortment features.
  - Features include: `shop_main_category_diversity_selected`, `shop_brand_diversity_selected`, `shop_utility_type_diversity_selected`, `shop_sub_category_diversity_selected`, `shop_most_frequent_main_category_selected`, `shop_most_frequent_brand_selected`, `is_shop_most_frequent_main_category`, `is_shop_most_frequent_brand`.
- ‚úÖ **Performance Improvement**: New features boosted Stratified CV R¬≤ (log target) to **0.3112** (from 0.2947).
- ‚úÖ **MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Overfitting was CV methodology issue, not model limitation (previous finding, still relevant).
- ‚úÖ **Performance Breakthrough (Baseline)**: Stratified CV by selection count ‚Üí R¬≤ = 0.2947 (vs 0.05 with incorrect CV).
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified**: Standard random CV doesn't respect selection count distribution structure.

## Current State
- **Repository**: ‚úÖ Updated with notebook for shop assortment features ([`notebooks/breakthrough_training.ipynb`](notebooks/breakthrough_training.ipynb:1)).
- **Data Processing**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - 178,736 events ‚Üí 98,741 combinations processed correctly. Shop features added.
- **Model Performance**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - CV R¬≤ (log target) = **0.3112** is respectable given natural ceiling of ~0.45.
- **Cross-Validation**: ‚úÖ **FIXED & APPLIED** - Stratified CV (5 splits) by selection count provides realistic estimates.
- **Overfitting Control**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Minimal overfitting (e.g., -0.0062) achieved with new features.
- **Business Integration**: ‚úÖ **READY (Enhanced Model)** - Model with shop features suitable for inventory guidance.
- **Expert Feedback**: ‚úÖ **RECEIVED** - Comprehensive guidance on next optimization steps and realistic expectations.

## Next Steps (Expert-Guided Optimization)

### Immediate Priority (Week 1-2) - Quick Wins
1. **CatBoost Implementation**: Switch from XGBoost to CatBoost with Poisson loss (no log transform needed).
   - Expected gain: 2-4 p.p. R¬≤ from proper count-aware objectives
   - Native categorical handling for high-cardinality features
2. **Two-Stage Model**: Implement binary classification (selected?) + count regression (how many?).
   - Expected gain: 8-25% RMSE reduction vs single model
3. **New Feature Engineering**: Add shop-level share and rank features.
   - `product_share_in_shop`, `brand_share_in_shop`, rank within shop

### Short Term (Week 3-4)
1. **Complete CatBoost Notebook**: Create new training notebook with CatBoost implementation.
2. **Two-Stage Pipeline**: Build and validate two-stage prediction pipeline.
3. **Leave-One-Shop-Out CV**: Implement to assess cold-start performance.
4. **API Integration Planning**: Design how two-stage predictions integrate with API.

### Medium Term (Month 1-2)
1. **Hierarchical Models**: Add random effects for shop/product if cold-start gap appears.
2. **Entity Embeddings**: Replace label encoders with learned embeddings.
3. **Business Metric Focus**: Optimize for aggregated MAPE (what drives overstock).
4. **Production Deployment**: Deploy optimized models with new architecture.

## Critical Technical Insights (BREAKTHROUGH & ENHANCEMENT)

### Root Cause of Previous Issues (Overfitting pre-0.2947)
- **Problem**: Standard random CV splits don't respect selection count distribution.
- **Solution**: Stratified CV by selection count bins: [0-1], [1-2], [2-5], [5-10], [10+].
- **Impact**: Performance estimate improved from R¬≤ ‚âà 0.05 to R¬≤ = 0.2947 (5.9x improvement).

### Shop Assortment Feature Impact
- **Enhancement**: Non-leaky shop-level features (diversity, most frequent selected category/brand, product's relation to these) further improved model performance.
- **Result**: CV R¬≤ (log target) increased from 0.2947 to **0.3112**.
- **Key New Features**: `shop_main_category_diversity_selected`, `shop_brand_diversity_selected`, `is_shop_most_frequent_main_category`, etc.

### Current Model Configuration (XGBoost - To Be Replaced)
```python
# CURRENT CONFIGURATION (WITH SHOP FEATURES)
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=1000, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.03,
    subsample=0.9, colsample_bytree=0.9, reg_alpha=0.3, reg_lambda=0.3,
    gamma=0.1, min_child_weight=8, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1
)
# Target: np.log1p(selection_count)  # Log transformation (to be removed with CatBoost)
# CV Method: StratifiedKFold (5 splits) by selection_count bins
# Features: Original 11 + Shop Assortment Features
# Current Performance: CV R¬≤ = 0.3112 ¬± 0.0070
```

### Target Model Configuration (CatBoost - NEW)
```python
# PLANNED CONFIGURATION (CatBoost with Poisson)
from catboost import CatBoostRegressor

model = CatBoostRegressor(
    iterations=1000,
    loss_function='Poisson',  # No log transform needed!
    cat_features=categorical_cols,  # Native categorical handling
    random_state=42
)
# Target: selection_count (raw counts, no transformation)
# CV Method: StratifiedKFold (5 splits) + Leave-One-Shop-Out
# Features: Original 11 + Shop Features + New share/rank features
# Expected Performance: CV R¬≤ = 0.35-0.40 (targeting 5-10 p.p. gain)
```

### Cross-Validation Methodology (CRITICAL)
```python
# CORRECT CV APPROACH (as used in notebook)
y_strata = pd.cut(y, bins=[0, 1, 2, 5, 10, np.inf], labels=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], include_lowest=True)
cv_stratified = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42) # n_splits=5 from notebook
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_for_cv, y_log_for_cv, cv=cv_stratified.split(X_for_cv, y_strata_for_cv), scoring='r2')
```

- **Integration**: ‚úÖ Enhanced model ready for API deployment
- **Next Phase**: üöÄ CatBoost + Two-stage implementation for quick gains

## Key Insights from ML Expert

### Why Current Performance is Actually Good
1. **Information Sparsity**: Selecting 1 gift from ~40-60 options creates natural noise
2. **No Silver Bullet**: We're near the ceiling for current features (~69% of max)
3. **Count Data Complexity**: Sparse integer targets are inherently difficult

### Critical Business Constraint Discovered
- **Price Features Won't Help**: All gifts in a shop are in same price range
- This eliminates a typical high-value feature source
- Must focus on other signals: merchandising, position, temporal patterns

### Path to R¬≤ ‚âà 0.40-0.45
1. **CatBoost + Poisson**: Better variance handling for count data (+2-4 p.p.)
2. **Two-Stage Model**: Binary + count regression (+3-6 p.p.)
3. **New Features**: Shop shares, ranks, interactions (+1-2 p.p.)
4. **Total Expected Gain**: +5-10 p.p. ‚Üí R¬≤ ‚âà 0.36-0.41

## Success Criteria Status (Revised)
- ‚úÖ **Technical optimization validated**: Current R¬≤ = 0.31 is respectable
- ‚úÖ **Clear improvement path**: Expert-guided roadmap to R¬≤ ‚âà 0.40+
- ‚úÖ **Business viability confirmed**: Current model provides value
- üöÄ **Next phase defined**: CatBoost + Two-stage quick wins identified

The project has reached a natural checkpoint. Expert validation confirms we're on the right track, with clear next steps for meaningful improvement without unrealistic expectations.
