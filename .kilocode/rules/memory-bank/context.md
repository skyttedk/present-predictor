## Current Work Focus
üöÄ **NEXT CRITICAL PHASE** - Data Pipeline Implementation with Optimal Three-File Architecture

Following comprehensive architectural analysis and gender classification API completion, the project has reached a major milestone with a **finalized optimal data structure** that solves all critical exposure calculation and data leakage issues.

## ‚úÖ MAJOR MILESTONES COMPLETED (June 26, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Gender Classification API - COMPLETED AND PRODUCTION READY**
**Implementation Date**: June 26, 2025 11:20-11:24
**Files Created/Modified**:
- ‚úÖ **Created**: [`src/api/schemas/gender_schemas.py`](src/api/schemas/gender_schemas.py:1) - Request/response models
- ‚úÖ **Updated**: [`src/api/main.py`](src/api/main.py:1) - Added both endpoints with proper integration

**Endpoints Available**:
1. **`POST /classify/gender`** - Single name classification
   - Input: `{"name": "Lars Nielsen"}`
   - Output: `{"name": "Lars Nielsen", "gender": "male", "confidence": "high", "processing_time_ms": 2.5}`

2. **`POST /classify/gender/batch`** - Batch processing (up to 1000 names)
   - Input: `{"names": ["Lars Nielsen", "Anna M√ºller", "John Smith"]}`
   - Output: Array of results with processing statistics

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Danish gender classification with fallback support
- ‚úÖ API key authentication required
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and validation
- ‚úÖ Performance tracking with processing time measurement
- ‚úÖ Confidence scoring for result quality assessment

**Ready for External Use**: Can now be used in external applications to prepare employee data with accurate male/female counts.

### ‚úÖ **Optimal API Request Structure - FINALIZED**
**Design Date**: June 26, 2025 17:22
**Status**: Architecturally complete and ready for implementation

**New Prediction Request Format (OPTIMAL)**:
```json
{
    "cvr": "28892055",
    "male_count": 12,
    "female_count": 11,
    "presents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "description": "Tisvilde Pizzaovn",
            "model_name": "Tisvilde Pizzaovn",
            "model_no": "",
            "vendor": "GaveFabrikken"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Benefits of This Structure**:
- ‚úÖ **Perfect Alignment**: Matches shop catalog structure (`male_count`, `female_count`)
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: No real-time gender classification needed
- ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: Uses known counts vs potentially error-prone name classification
- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Same data format for training and prediction
- ‚úÖ **Business Logic**: Companies already know their gender distribution
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: No dependency on classification accuracy

**Impact**: This structure creates perfect consistency between training data and prediction requests, enabling optimal model performance.

### ‚úÖ **Optimal Data Architecture - FINALIZED**
**Design Date**: June 26, 2025 17:36
**Status**: Architecturally complete and ready for implementation
**Discovery**: One shop can have multiple companies - requires three-file structure for optimal granularity

**Three-File Structure (FINAL)**:

#### **File 1: present.selection.historic.csv** (Training Events)
```csv
shop_id,company_cvr,employee_gender,gift_id,product_main_category,product_sub_category,product_brand,product_color,product_durability,product_target_gender,product_utility_type,product_type
shop123,12233445,male,gift789,Home & Kitchen,Cookware,Fiskars,NONE,durable,unisex,practical,individual
shop123,12233445,female,gift234,Bags,Toiletry Bag,Markberg,black,durable,female,practical,individual
```
- **Purpose**: Each row = ONE historical selection event with company granularity
- **Benefits**: Company-level selection patterns, perfect CVR alignment

#### **File 2: shop.catalog.csv** (Available Gifts)
```csv
shop_id,gift_id
shop123,gift789
shop123,gift234
shop123,gift567
shop456,gift789
shop456,gift111
```
- **Purpose**: Defines what gifts are available in each shop
- **Benefits**: Clean separation of gift availability from company demographics

#### **File 3: company.employees.csv** (Exposure Metadata)
```csv
company_cvr,branch_code,male_count,female_count
12233445,12600,12,34
34446505,12601,10,3
14433445,12600,22,12
```
- **Purpose**: Company-specific employee counts for accurate exposure calculation
- **Benefits**:
  - ‚úÖ **Perfect Granularity**: Company-level modeling (better than shop-level)
  - ‚úÖ **CVR Alignment**: Direct match with API request structure
  - ‚úÖ **Accurate Exposure**: Gender-specific denominators per company
  - ‚úÖ **Zero Data Leakage**: Employee counts are external business metadata

## üéØ CRITICAL ISSUES - ALL SOLVED BY NEW ARCHITECTURE

### ‚úÖ **Exposure Problem - ARCHITECTURALLY SOLVED**
- **Previous Issue**: Wrong exposure calculation using combined male+female counts
- **Solution**: Gender-specific `male_count`, `female_count` from company metadata
- **Implementation**: `exposure = company_employees[company_cvr][f"{gender}_count"]`

### ‚úÖ **Zero-Selection Blindness - ARCHITECTURALLY SOLVED**
- **Previous Issue**: Only learned from selected gifts
- **Solution**: Shop catalog + company employees defines complete universe
- **Implementation**: Can identify unselected gifts for each company and train on complete offer/selection data

### ‚úÖ **Data Leakage - ARCHITECTURALLY ELIMINATED**
- **Previous Issue**: Shop features based on selection counts
- **Solution**: Employee counts are external business metadata
- **Implementation**: Clean separation of "what was offered" vs "what was selected"

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES

### **Priority 1: Data Pipeline Implementation** (Week 1)
**Status**: üöÄ **CRITICAL NEXT PHASE**
**Timeline**: 2-3 days implementation + 1-2 days validation

**Key Components to Implement**:
1. **Training Data Loader**:
   - Load all three CSV files
   - Join selections with shop catalog and company employees
   - Create training records with proper company-level exposure
   - Add zero-selection records for unselected gifts per company

2. **CatBoost Training Updates**:
   - Use `selection_rate` as target (selections/company_exposure)
   - Use RMSE loss function (predicting rates, not counts)
   - Proper log-exposure offset via `baseline` parameter
   - Include company_cvr as feature for company-specific patterns

3. **Enhanced Prediction Pipeline**:
   - ‚úÖ **API Request Structure**: Accept CVR + direct `male_count`, `female_count`
   - Map CVR to get company-specific exposure data
   - Predict selection rates per gender per company
   - Scale by exposure: `expected_count = predicted_rate * company_gender_count`
   - **Perfect CVR Alignment**: Request format matches training data exactly

### **Priority 2: Validation & Testing** (Week 2)
- Cross-validation with shop-level splits (prevent leakage)
- Business metrics validation (realistic selection rates)
- API integration testing
