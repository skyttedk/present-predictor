# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: Production Ready
**Last Updated**: June 20, 2025

## Current Work Focus
**CORE LOGIC FIXED**: The prediction pipeline now correctly handles gender-based weighting and normalizes the final output to ensure the total predicted quantity matches the number of employees.

**Successfully Implemented**:
1.  **Gender-Weighted Predictions (June 20, 2025)**:
    -   The `_aggregate_predictions` method in [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) now correctly calculates the expected quantity for each gender subgroup.
    -   Formula: `expected_qty_gender = model_output * gender_ratio * total_employees`

2.  **Prediction Normalization (June 20, 2025)**:
    -   The main `predict` method in [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) now treats the initial predictions as "popularity scores."
    -   These scores are summed, and each individual score is normalized against the total to ensure the final sum of `expected_qty` equals `total_employees`.
    -   Formula: `final_qty = (raw_score / total_raw_scores) * total_employees`

3.  **Validation Results**:
    -   **Before**: Total predicted quantity (`~843`) far exceeded the number of employees (`57`).
    -   **After**: Total predicted quantity (`57`) now correctly matches the number of employees. Predictions are distributed proportionally based on the model's assessment of popularity.

## Recent Changes
-   **June 20, 2025**:
    -   ✅ Fixed gender-based prediction weighting in `_aggregate_predictions`.
    -   ✅ Implemented normalization logic in the main `predict` method.
    -   ✅ Tested and verified that the total predicted quantity now matches the number of employees.
    -   ✅ Updated `architecture.md` to reflect the new, correct data flow.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1.  **Production Monitoring**:
    -   Monitor prediction distributions in production.
    -   Track business validation against actual selections.
    -   Log feature resolution and normalization statistics.

2.  **Long-term Enhancement**:
    -   Obtain historical employee count data per shop/order.
    -   Retrain the model with a rate-based target (e.g., `selection_rate = selection_count / total_employees_in_shop`) to make the model's output more directly interpretable and potentially remove the need for post-hoc normalization.

3.  **Performance Optimization**:
    -   Consider caching frequent feature lookups in the `ShopFeatureResolver`.
    -   Investigate batching predictions for improved performance.
