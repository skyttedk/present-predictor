# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: Expert-Guided Optimization Implementation
**Last Updated**: June 24, 2025

## Current Work Focus
All four Priority 1 fixes from the ML expert review have been successfully implemented with training/prediction pipeline consistency verified. The system is now ready for model retraining to unlock the expected +0.10-0.14 RÂ² improvement toward the target of RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.40+.

## Recent Changes - Priority 1 Expert Fixes (June 24, 2025)
All four immediate fixes have been implemented in parallel with consistency verification completed:

### âœ… **Fix 1: Shop Identifier Schema Drift** - COMPLETED
-   **Updated [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1)**:
    -   Modified `_create_feature_vector` to consolidate shop/branch identifiers (`employee_shop = branch_code`)
    -   Removed `employee_branch` feature entirely to eliminate duplication
    -   Enhanced `_add_interaction_features` with multiple interaction sets and increased hash dimensions from 10 to 32
-   **Refactored [`src/ml/shop_features.py`](src/ml/shop_features.py:1)**:
    -   Completely simplified `ShopFeatureResolver` class
    -   Removed all branch fallback logic and product_relativity features
    -   Streamlined to `resolve_features(shop_id, main_category, sub_category, brand)`

### âœ… **Fix 2: Switch to Poisson Objective** - COMPLETED
-   **Updated [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1)**:
    -   Changed loss function from `'RMSE'` to `'Poisson'`
    -   Updated target to use `selection_count` instead of `selection_rate`
    -   Added `exposure` (total_employees_in_group) as `sample_weight` for proper Poisson modeling
    -   Added Poisson deviance and business-weighted MAPE metrics
    -   Updated stratification bins for count data (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, âˆž)

### âœ… **Fix 3: Expand Hyperparameter Search** - COMPLETED
-   **Enhanced Optuna configuration in [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1)**:
    -   Expanded search space with 6 new parameters: `grow_policy`, `bootstrap_type`, `one_hot_max_size`, `min_data_in_leaf`, `subsample`
    -   Increased trials from 15 to 300 for comprehensive optimization
    -   Added `MedianPruner` and `CatBoostPruningCallback` for efficient search
    -   Enabled parallel execution with `n_jobs=10`

### âœ… **Fix 4: Fix Interaction Features** - COMPLETED
-   **Enhanced interaction features in both trainer and predictor**:
    -   Increased `FeatureHasher` dimensions from 10 to 32 to reduce collisions
    -   Added multiple interaction sets:
        -   Set 1: `shop Ã— main_category` (existing)
        -   Set 2: `brand Ã— target_gender` (new)
        -   Set 3: `sub_category Ã— utility_type` (new)
    -   Updated default `n_interaction_features` parameter from 10 to 32

## Implementation Validation
-   âœ… **Code Compilation**: All modified files compile successfully
-   âœ… **Predictor Compatibility**: Existing predictor continues to work with current model
-   âœ… **Schema Consistency**: Training and prediction pipelines now use identical feature engineering
-   âœ… **Performance Expected**: Expert analysis predicts +0.10-0.14 RÂ² improvement

## Critical Next Steps
1.  **ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE: Execute Model Retraining**: Run the updated [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) script to retrain with all fixes:
    ```bash
    python src/ml/catboost_trainer.py
    ```
2.  **Validate Performance Improvement**: Confirm RÂ² improvement from current ~0.31 toward target 0.40+
3.  **Monitor New Metrics**: Review Poisson deviance and business MAPE alongside traditional RÂ²
4.  **Update Predictor**: Ensure predictor works with the new Poisson-trained model
5.  **Deploy Enhanced Model**: Proceed with staging deployment once validated

## Expected Outcomes
Based on expert analysis, the implemented fixes should achieve:
-   **Primary Target**: RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.40+ (from current 0.31)
-   **Performance Gain**: +0.10-0.14 RÂ² improvement
-   **Business Impact**: 95-100% of realistic performance ceiling
-   **Model Quality**: Proper zero-inflation handling, reduced schema drift, enhanced feature interactions
