# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: Model Refinement (Post-Re-architecture)
**Last Updated**: June 24, 2025

## Current Work Focus
The core re-architecture is complete, and the focus has shifted to refining the training pipeline based on detailed feedback from an ML expert. The goal is to improve the model's robustness, ensure evaluation metrics are reliable, and adhere to ML best practices before deployment.

## Recent Changes
-   **June 24, 2025**:
    -   ✅ **Fixed Data Leakage**: Refactored the `engineer_shop_assortment_features` function in [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) to compute shop-level aggregates on the training set only, preventing data leakage into the validation set.
    -   ✅ **Corrected Loss Function Naming**: Aligned all comments, file paths, and internal script references in the trainer to use `RMSE` instead of the incorrect `Poisson`, improving clarity.
    -   ✅ **Clamped Predictions**: Ensured model predictions in both [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) and [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) are clamped between 0 and 1 using `np.clip(..., 0, 1)`, which is correct for a rate-based target.
    -   ✅ **Improved Feature Alignment**: Implemented a robust feature alignment strategy to ensure the training and validation sets have identical feature sets, preventing errors from mismatched columns.
    -   ✅ **Enhanced Feature Hashing**: Improved the `FeatureHasher` implementation in both [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) and [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to use meaningful sub-tokens, enhancing the quality of interaction features.
    -   ✅ **Prevented Shop Resolver Leakage**: Modified [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) to save training-data-only shop aggregates. Updated [`src/ml/shop_features.py`](src/ml/shop_features.py:1) and [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to load and use these static aggregates, preventing data leakage during prediction.
    -   ✅ **Robust Numeric Median Handling**: Enhanced [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) to ensure all numeric features have a non-NaN median saved. Improved [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to log critical errors if expected medians are missing during imputation, enhancing robustness against out-of-distribution values.
    -   ✅ **Consolidated Shop/Branch Identifier**: Modified [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) to set `employee_shop` equal to `employee_branch` during data loading. This standardizes the shop-level identifier across training and prediction, ensuring features are derived consistently. **This change necessitates model retraining.**
    -   ✅ **Revised Confidence Score**: Updated the `_calculate_confidence` method in [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to use model RMSE for a more interpretable confidence score (0.5 to 0.95 range). Loaded RMSE from `model_metadata.pkl`.
    -   ✅ **Dynamic Feature Loading**: Modified [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to load `expected_columns` (as `features_used`) and `categorical_features` (as `categorical_features_in_model`) from `model_metadata.pkl` to prevent schema drift between training and prediction.
    -   ✅ **Production-Ready Predictor Caching**: Updated the `get_predictor` function in [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to cache the `GiftDemandPredictor` instance, preventing repeated model loading in a server environment.
    -   ✅ **Internal Type Hint Refinement**: Modified internal methods in [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) (e.g., `predict`, `_predict_for_present`) to return plain Python dictionaries (`Dict`) instead of `PredictionResult` Pydantic models, simplifying internal logic. Pydantic model coercion is left to the API layer.
    -   ✅ **Updated Predictor Docstring**: Corrected the module docstring in [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to accurately reflect that the model predicts selection rates, not Poisson-based quantities.
    -   ✅ **Enhanced Schema Mismatch Logging**: Modified `_prepare_features` in [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) to log (at INFO level) any columns that are added to the DataFrame to match the expected schema, aiding in the detection of schema mismatches.

## Next Steps
1.  **CRITICAL: Re-run Training Pipeline**: Execute the updated [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) script to retrain the model. This is essential due to the consolidation of `employee_shop` and `employee_branch` identifiers, other feature engineering refinements, and to ensure `model_metadata.pkl` contains the `rmse_validation` for the new confidence score logic, as well as the `features_used` and `categorical_features_in_model` lists.
2.  **Analyze New Metrics**: Review the performance metrics of the newly trained model to confirm that the fixes have resulted in a more reliable evaluation.
3.  **Deploy the Refined Model**: Once the new model is validated, proceed with deployment to a staging or production environment.
4.  **Monitor Performance**: Closely monitor the model's performance in a live environment.
5.  **Update Architecture Documentation**: Update [`architecture.md`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md:1) to reflect the refined training process and data handling logic.
