# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: Production Ready (Post-Re-architecture)
**Last Updated**: June 23, 2025

## Current Work Focus
The critical re-architecture of the ML pipeline is complete. The system now uses a rate-based prediction model, which has resolved the previous issues of uniform and unreliable predictions. The focus has now shifted to deploying, monitoring, and further improving this new, stable model.

## Recent Changes
-   **June 23, 2025**:
    -   ✅ **Re-architected the Data Pipeline**: Modified [`src/ml/catboost_trainer.py`](src/ml/catboost_trainer.py:1) to use `selection_rate` as the target variable instead of `selection_count`.
    -   ✅ **Retrained the Model**: Successfully trained a new `CatBoostRegressor` model on the `selection_rate` target using an `RMSE` loss function. The new model achieves a validation R² of ~0.34.
    -   ✅ **Corrected the Prediction Pipeline**: Verified that [`src/ml/predictor.py`](src/ml/predictor.py:1) correctly loads the new model and uses rate-based aggregation (`predicted_qty = predicted_rate * employee_count`) without artificial normalization.
    -   ✅ **Validated the Full Pipeline**: Created and ran a smoke test ([`scripts/smoke_test.py`](scripts/smoke_test.py:1)) to confirm the end-to-end system produces valid, non-uniform predictions.
    -   ✅ **Completed Expert Recommendations**: The core technical changes recommended by the ML expert have been implemented.

## Next Steps
1.  **Deploy the New Model**:
    -   The newly trained model and updated prediction service are ready for deployment to a staging or production environment.

2.  **Monitor Performance**:
    -   Closely monitor the model's performance in a live environment, tracking prediction accuracy and business impact (e.g., inventory levels).

3.  **Iterate and Improve**:
    -   Explore further feature engineering now that the core architecture is stable.
    -   Consider implementing a more robust cross-validation strategy within the training script.
    -   Update other documentation (`architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`) to reflect the final state of the new architecture.
