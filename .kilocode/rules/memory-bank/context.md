# Current Context

## Project Status
**Phase**: Initial Setup
**Last Updated**: December 6, 2025

## Current Work Focus
Setting up the foundational structure for the Predictive Gift Selection System. The project is in the very early stages with basic project documentation and version control configuration completed.

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file for Python project
- Memory bank initialization in progress
- Project requirements documented in `why.txt`

## Current State
- **Repository**: Initialized with git ignore configuration
- **Documentation**: Project overview and requirements defined
- **Code Structure**: Not yet implemented
- **Dependencies**: Not yet defined
- **Development Environment**: Not yet set up

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create standard Python project directory structure
   - Set up virtual environment configuration
   - Initialize requirements.txt

2. **Data Pipeline Foundation**
   - Design data schema for historical gift selection records
   - Plan data preprocessing pipeline structure
   - Define data aggregation patterns

3. **API Design**
   - Create OpenAPI/Swagger specification
   - Design request/response schemas
   - Plan internal data transformation logic

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Core Development**
   - Implement data preprocessing modules
   - Build feature engineering pipeline
   - Create XGBoost model training framework

2. **API Development**
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints
   - Build request validation and data classification
   - Integrate prediction engine

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. **Model Training and Validation**
   - Train initial XGBoost models on historical data
   - Implement model evaluation metrics
   - Create model performance monitoring

2. **System Integration**
   - End-to-end testing of prediction pipeline
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling and logging

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Historical gift selection data access needed for model training
- Clarification needed on data format and availability
- Infrastructure requirements for deployment

## Key Decisions Pending
- Data storage strategy (local files vs database)
- Model training frequency and update mechanism
- Deployment architecture (cloud vs on-premise)
- Authentication and security requirements for API
