## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create standard Python project directory structure
   - Set up virtual environment configuration
   - Initialize requirements.txt

2. **Data Pipeline Foundation**
   - Design data schema for historical gift selection records
   - Plan data preprocessing pipeline structure
   - Define data aggregation patterns

3. **API Design**
   - Create OpenAPI/Swagger specification
   - Design request/response schemas
   - Plan internal data transformation logic

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Core Development**
   - Implement data preprocessing modules
   - Build feature engineering pipeline
   - Create XGBoost model training framework

2. **API Development**
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints
   - Build request validation and data classification
   - Integrate prediction engine

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. **Model Training and Validation**
   - Train initial XGBoost models on historical data
   - Implement model evaluation metrics
   - Create model performance monitoring

2. **System Integration**
   - End-to-end testing of prediction pipeline
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling and logging

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Historical gift selection data access needed for model training
- Clarification needed on data format and availability
- Infrastructure requirements for deployment

## Key Decisions Pending
- Data storage strategy (local files vs database)
- Model training frequency and update mechanism
- Deployment architecture (cloud vs on-premise)
- Authentication and security requirements for API
